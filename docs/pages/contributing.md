We use eslint and prettier to make sure we are using consistent code styling and formatting. To help enforce these rules we use a husky pre commit hook which gets setup when installing dependencies.

Before submitting your contribution, make sure to test your changes thoroughly. This includes running existing tests and adding new tests if necessary. Ensure that all tests pass before opening a pull request.
